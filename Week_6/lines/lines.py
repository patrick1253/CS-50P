# CS50 assignment: in a file called lines.py, implement a program that expects exactly one 
# command-line argument, the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines 
# of code in that file, excluding comments and blank lines. If the user does not specify exactly 
# one command-line argument, or if the specified fileâ€™s name does not end in .py, or if the 
# specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.

# Assume that any line that starts with #, optionally preceded by whitespace, is a comment. (A docstring 
# should not be considered a comment.) Assume that any line that only contains whitespace is blank.
