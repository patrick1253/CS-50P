# CS50 assignment: In a file called working.py, implement a function called convert that 
# expects a str in any of the 12-hour formats below and returns the corresponding str in 
# 24-hour format (i.e., 9:00 to 17:00). Expect that AM and PM will be capitalized (with no 
# periods therein) and that there will be a space before each. Assume that these times are 
# representative of actual times, not necessarily 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM specifically.

#    9:00 AM to 5:00 PM
#    9 AM to 5 PM
#    9:00 AM to 5 PM
#    9 AM to 5:00 PM

# Raise a ValueError instead if the input to convert is not in either of those formats or if 
# either time is invalid (e.g., 12:60 AM, 13:00 PM, etc.). But do not assume that someoneâ€™s 
# hours will start ante meridiem and end post meridiem; someone might work late and even long h
# ours (e.g., 5:00 PM to 9:00 AM).
