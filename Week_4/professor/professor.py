# CS50 assignment:  implement a program that:

#   Prompts the user for a level, n. If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.
#   Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , wherein each of X and Y is a 
#       non-negative integer with n digits. No need to support operations other than addition (+).
#    Prompts the user to solve each of those problems. If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), 
#       the program should output EEE and prompt the user again, allowing the user up to three tries in total 
#       for that problem. If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program should 
#       output the correct answer.
#   The program should ultimately output the userâ€™s score: the number of correct answers out of 10.

# Structure your program as follows, wherein get_level prompts (and, if need be, re-prompts) the user for a 
# level and returns 1, 2, or 3, and generate_integer returns a randomly generated non-negative integer with 
# level digits or raises a ValueError if level is not 1, 2, or 3:
