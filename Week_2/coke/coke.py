# CS50 assignment: In a file called coke.py, implement a program that prompts the 
# user to insert a coin, one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due. 
# Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents in change the 
# user is owed. Assume that the user will only input integers, and ignore any integer 
# that isnâ€™t an accepted denomination.
